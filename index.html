                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast with a focus on red teaming and web security. I have completed a comprehensive web full-stack course to deepen my understanding of the technologies I encounter in my work. My hands-on experience includes tackling various labs and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges from platforms like PicoCTF, VulnHub, and PortSwigger.</p>
                <p>In my lab work, I concentrate on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and leverage the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain framework to enhance my skills. This combination of structured learning and practical application has equipped me with a solid foundation in identifying and addressing security issues.</p>
                <p>Please take a moment to review my CTF's and labs listed below:</p>
