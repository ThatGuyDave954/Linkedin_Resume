            <h2>Lab Overview</h2>
            <p>This lab focused on exploiting a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within an anchor tag's `href` attribute, where double quotes are HTML-encoded</p>

                Lab: Stored XSS into anchor href attribute with double quotes HTML-encoded

            <h2>Lab Work</h2>
            <p>To begin, I loaded the lab and identified input fields that could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks</p>
            <img src="../Images/PS Stored XSS/home page.png" alt="Lab Home Page">
            <p>Upon inspecting a blog post, I found a comment section with two potentially vulnerable input fields</p>
            <img src="../Images/PS Stored XSS/comment section.png" alt="Comment Section">
            <p>My first attempt involved injecting a simple alert payload into the comment field:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
            <img src="../Images/PS Stored XSS/first payload.png" alt="First Payload Attempt">
            <p>This payload did not yield the expected results, so I proceeded to test the URI field, targeting it with the following payload:</p>
            <pre><code>javascript:alert(1)</code></pre>
            <p>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string used to identify resources such as webpages, files, or email addresses. Exploiting the URI field is a common technique for triggering XSS attacks</p>
            <p>Using Burp Suite, I intercepted the original request and modified it in the Repeater tool to inject the payload before resending the request</p>
            <p>The second payload successfully exploited the vulnerable URI field, resulting in the alert box appearing</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This lab demonstrated the importance of testing all input fields for potential vulnerabilities. I tested two fields: the comment section and the URI field. While the comment field did not result in a successful XSS attack, the URI field was vulnerable, and I was able to execute a stored XSS payload.</p>
            
            <p>This vulnerability falls under the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/">OWASP Top 10 A03: Injection</a> category, specifically within the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) subset. XSS vulnerabilities account for approximately 18% of reported security issues and remain a significant risk to web applications.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Ensuring robust input validation, output encoding, and HTML sanitization is essential for mitigating XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically:</p>
            <p>All variables should undergo strict validation and sanitization before use.</p>
            <p>Output encoding ensures that user input is safely rendered on the page.</p>
            <p>Using tools like Content Security Policies (CSPs) can provide additional layers of protection.</p>
