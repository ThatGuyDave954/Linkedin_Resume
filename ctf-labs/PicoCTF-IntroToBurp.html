            <p> Let's go ahead and navigate to the webpage for this challenge</p>
            <p>I go ahead and input information into the fields and intercept the request through BurpSuite</p>

            <p>After filling out that information it takes us to a second page for a One Time Password, which we do not have</p>

            <p> Let's go ahead and update the OTP field to see if it will bypass the OTP request</p>

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>In this challenge I was able to manipulate the OTP password field and bypass what security feature they had in place. To mitigate this issue I would implement automated systems to detect and respond to
                 potential threats in real-time, such as flagging suspicious login attempts or triggering additional verification steps for high-risk activities. </p>
